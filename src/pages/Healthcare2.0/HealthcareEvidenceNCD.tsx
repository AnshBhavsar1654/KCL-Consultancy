                Non-communicable diseases are a growing cause of morbidity and mortality in Gujarat, creating long-term health and economic challenges. Preventive strategies, particularly early detection through population-based screening, have proven effective in reducing the burden of NCDs in several states. For Gujarat, the critical question was when and how such an initiative should be rolled out.

                The team assessed Gujaratâ€™s projected NCD burden for 2025 and compared it with the levels at which states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh launched their door-to-door screening programmes. The analysis indicated that Gujarat was entering a similar risk zone, making this a timely moment to initiate comprehensive screening. Recommendations also included instituting mandatory health screening for the government workforce as a model for early detection and preventive care.

              <p>
                The findings provided clear justification for early intervention, equipping the state with evidence to act decisively on NCDs and reduce the risk of escalating disease burden in the years ahead.
